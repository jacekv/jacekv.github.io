# Use Python's Logging Module with a Trace Id

Python's logging module is a powerful tool for debugging and monitoring your
code. It allows you to log messages at different levels of severity, and to
direct those messages to different destinations, such as the console, a file,
or a network socket.

If you have a simple application, you can use the logging module without a
trace id, since it's easy to see which log messages are associated with which
requests. However, if you have a more complex application, with multiple
threads or processes handling multiple requests, it can be difficult to
correlate log messages with the requests that generated them.

In this case, you can use a trace id to associate log messages with requests.
A trace id is a unique identifier that is generated for each request, and is
included in all log messages generated by that request. This allows you to
easily filter log messages by trace id, and see all the log messages associated
with a particular request.

Here's an example of how you can use a trace id with Python's logging module:

```python
import logging
import uuid


def get_trace_id():
    return uuid.uuid4()


class ContextFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        record.trace_id = get_trace_id()
        return True


LOG_LEVEL = logging.INFO

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(LOG_LEVEL)

formatter = logging.Formatter("[%(trace_id)s][%(asctime)s] - %(message)s")

stream = logging.StreamHandler()
stream.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(stream)
logger.addFilter(ContextFilter())

logger.info("Hello, world!")
```

And the output will be:

```
[e41ee44c-704e-40b6-803c-1ed9844b1f92][2024-08-28 10:09:09,243] - Hello, world!
```

In this example, we define a `get_trace_id` function that generates a unique
trace id for each request using Python's `uuid` module.If you have a different
way of generating trace ids, you can replace this function with your own
implementation.

We also define a `ContextFilter` class that adds the trace id to each log
message using the `filter` method. We then create a logger, set its log level
to `INFO`, and add a stream handler that formats log messages with the trace id
and the timestamp.

Finally, we log a message using the logger, and the trace id is included in the
output.

By using a trace id with Python's logging module, you can easily associate log
messages with requests, and quickly identify and debug issues in your
application.
